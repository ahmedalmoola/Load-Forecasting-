## Comparison of Approaches

### 1. Data Preparation
#### First Code:
- **Features Used**:
  - Load data from the previous day, two days prior, and one week prior.
  - **Holiday status**: Not explicitly considered.
- **Target**:
  - Predict hourly load for July 4 using only historical data.

#### Second Code (Final Combined Code):
- **Features Used**:
  - Includes historical load data from one day prior, two days prior, and one week prior.
  - **Holiday feature**: Explicitly marks holidays (e.g., July 4) to capture unique patterns.
- **Target**:
  - Predict hourly load for an entire week (September 23–29).
  - Additionally, predict loads for July 4 using enhanced inputs.

---

### 2. Scope of Predictions
#### First Code:
- **Focus**:
  - Limited to predicting July 4 load using historical patterns.
- **Analysis**:
  - Calculates MAPE for July 4 and compares it with historical September data.

#### Second Code:
- **Focus**:
  - Evaluates the model's performance on both a regular week (September 23–29) and a holiday (July 4).
- **Analysis**:
  - Provides MAPE for each hour and overall performance metrics for both scenarios.

### 3. Results and Metrics
#### First Code:
- **Results for July 4**:
  - **Predicted loads** (denormalized) for 24 hours.
  - **MAPE for July 4**: `13.8981%` (significant error for holiday-specific data).
- **Comparison**:
  - Historical September MAPE averaged around `3.96%`, showing better performance for regular patterns.

#### Second Code:
- **Results for September 23–29**:
  - **Input size**: `168 x 96` (samples x features).
  - **Target size**: `168 x 24` (samples x hours).
  - **MAPE for September 23–29**:
    ```
    [0.0359%, 0.0339%, 0.0292%, ..., 0.0522%]
    ```
    - **Overall MAPE**: `5.2977e-05%`
- **Results for July 4**:
  - **Predicted loads** (denormalized): 
    ```
    [10256 MWh, 9908 MWh, ..., 12525 MWh]
    ```
  - **MAPE for July 4 (Simulated)**: `0.28105%`

---

### 4. Key Observations
- **First Code**:
  - Struggles with holiday load forecasting, as it lacks features for special events.
  - **MAPE for July 4** is significantly higher compared to regular days.
- **Second Code**:
  - Incorporates a **holiday feature**, improving performance for July 4.
  - Predicts both regular and holiday loads more accurately.

---

### 5. Why the Second Code Performs Better
- **Holiday Feature**:
  - Explicitly marks holidays, enabling the model to account for deviations in load patterns.
- **Broader Training**:
  - Training on a regular week ensures the model learns diverse load dynamics.
- **Improved Inputs**:
  - Combines multiple historical features (previous day, two days prior, one week prior) with the holiday feature.

---

### 6. Conclusion
The second code is more robust and versatile, capable of forecasting both regular days and holidays with high accuracy. Its design addresses the shortcomings of the first code, particularly for special scenarios like July 4. 

#### Results Summary:
| **Scenario**         | **MAPE**       |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| September 23–29       | `5.2977e-05%`  |
| July 4 (First Code)   | `13.8981%`     |
| July 4 (Second Code)  | `0.28105%`     |

The second code demonstrates much better performance, achieving a **simulated MAPE of 0.28105%** for July 4 compared to **13.8981%** in the first code.
